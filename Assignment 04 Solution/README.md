## Assignment 4: Python data structures and operations

For Assignment 4, I explored various data structures and operations in Python, including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. This assignment allowed me to deepen my understanding of these concepts and demonstrate proficiency in implementing them effectively.

### Key Tasks Completed:

- **Q1: Lists:** 

  - a) Created an empty list and populated it with integers.
  - b) Performed the following operations on the list:
    
    1. Added elements at the beginning and end of the list.
    2. Removed an element from the list by its value.
    3. Sorted the list in ascending order.
    4. Checked if a specific element exists in the list.
    5. Displayed the final list after each operation.

- **Q2: Tuples:**

    - a) Created a tuple of my favorite foods.
    
    - b) Accessed and printed the elements of the tuple.
       
    - c) Converted the tuple to a list and modified one of the elements.
       
    - d) Converted the modified list back to a tuple.
       
    - e) Displayed the final tuple.

- **Q3: Sets:**

  - a) Created two sets containing random integers.
     
  - b) Performed set operations, including union, intersection, and difference.
     
  - c) Determined if one set is a subset or superset of the other.
     
  - d) Displayed the results of each operation.

- **Q4: Dictionaries:**

  - a) Created a dictionary with keys representing fruits and values representing their prices.
     
  - b) Added new key-value pairs to the dictionary.
     
  - c) Accessed and printed the value of a specific key.
     
  - d) Modified the value of an existing key.
     
  - e) Deleted a key-value pair from the dictionary.
     
  - f) Displayed the final dictionary after each operation.

- **Q5: Employee Dataset:**

  - a) Created a list called "employees" and populated it with three employee records, each represented as a dictionary.
  
  - b) Calculated the average salary of all employees in the "employees" list and printed the result.
  
  - c) Converted the list of employees into a set called "unique_departments" to obtain a set of unique department names.
  
  - d) Created a tuple called "highest_paid_employee" and assigned the details of the employee with the highest salary to it.
  
  - e) Displayed the final "employees" list, "unique_departments" set, and "highest_paid_employee" tuple.

### Submission Details:

To submit the assignment, I saved my Python script in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file and uploaded it to my GitHub repository. The submission deadline for this assignment was 07-02-24.
