# Online Cheating Detection

This project aims to develop a system for detecting cheating in online exams. The system analyzes various factors and patterns to identify potential cheating behaviors and provide insights to instructors.


## Features

- Real-time monitoring of exam sessions
- Detection of suspicious activities such as copy-pasting, switching tabs, or accessing unauthorized resources
- Automated flagging and alerting of potential cheating incidents
- Detailed reports and analytics for instructors to review exam integrity

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YameenAli/Online_Exams-Cheating-Detection.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the database connection in `config.js`
4. Start the application: `npm start`

## Usage

1. Login to the system as an instructor or administrator.
2. Create an exam and configure the settings.
3. Share the exam link with the students.
4. Monitor the exam sessions in real-time.
5. Review the cheating detection reports and take necessary actions.
