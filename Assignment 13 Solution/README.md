# Titanic Dataset Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains an assignment focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The assignment is designed to help students practice their data analysis skills using the `pandas` and `numpy` libraries in Python. Students will learn to manipulate and analyze data, generate insights, and create new features.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, students will:

1. Gain familiarity with basic data manipulation and analysis using the `pandas` library.
2. Learn to compute basic statistics and perform descriptive analysis on the dataset.
3. Understand how to visualize and interpret data distributions.
4. Explore relationships between different features in the dataset.
5. Practice feature engineering to create new meaningful features from existing data.
6. Enhance their understanding of survival analysis and its implications.

## Assignment Tasks

### 1. Basic Overview
- **a)** How many passengers are in the Titanic dataset?
- **b)** What are the column names of this dataset?
- **c)** Write the values of the Survived column?

### 2. Demographics
- **a)** How many males and females were aboard the Titanic?
- **b)** Which age group had the highest number of passengers?
- **c)** Calculate the mean and median age of passengers using `numpy`.

### 3. Travel Class & Fare
- **a)** How many passengers were in each class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)?
- **b)** What's the average fare for each class? Is there a correlation between fare and class?
- **c)** Calculate the standard deviation of fares using `numpy`.

### 4. Survival Analysis
- **a)** What's the overall survival rate of passengers?
- **b)** Does gender influence the chances of survival?
- **c)** Which class had the highest survival rate?

### 5. Embarkation
- **a)** From which port did most passengers embark?
- **b)** Was there a relationship between embarkation port and survival rate?

### 6. Cabin & Accommodation
- **a)** How many passengers had cabins? And how many did not?
- **b)** Is there any correlation between having a cabin and survival?

### 7. Family
- **a)** How many passengers traveled alone, and how many traveled with family?
- **b)** Does traveling with family or alone influence the chances of survival?

### 8. Feature Engineering
- **a)** Can you create a new feature "IsChild" which is True for passengers under 10 and False otherwise?
- **b)** How does being a child relate to the chances of survival?
