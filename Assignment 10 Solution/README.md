# Overview

This repository contains solutions for Assignment 10 of the Data Science course. The assignment includes a variety of tasks that demonstrate proficiency in Python programming, mathematical computations, and data manipulation. Below is an overview of the topics covered and the problems solved.

## Topics Covered

1. **Student Grading System**: 
    - Implement a function to calculate student grades based on their scores.
    - Ensure input validation for score range and type.

2. **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**:
    - Compute the Discrete Fourier Transform of a given discrete signal using basic mathematical operations.
    - Avoid reliance on external libraries such as NumPy or SciPy.

3. **Poisson Distribution Simulation**:
    - Simulate the number of user visits in a 5-minute interval using the Poisson distribution.
    - Analyze the probability of occurrences based on a given average rate.

4. **Inventory Management**:
    - Categorize and organize products based on their availability status.
    - Assign unique product IDs, categorize products, and select a product for promotion.

5. **Randomized Quiz Generator**:
    - Generate randomized quizzes from a predefined question bank.
    - Ensure each quiz has a unique set of questions to prevent cheating and encourage understanding.
