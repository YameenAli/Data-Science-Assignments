## Assignment 3: Python Fundamentals

For Assignment 3, I delved into fundamental concepts in Python programming, covering lists, tuples, input/output operations, and operators. This assignment served as an opportunity for me to solidify my understanding of these core Python concepts and demonstrate my proficiency in implementing them effectively.

### Key Tasks Completed:

- **Lists and Tuples**:
  - Created an empty list `my_list` and performed operations such as appending, inserting, and removing elements.
  - Explored tuple creation, unpacking, concatenation, and accessed elements using both positive and negative indexing to showcase their immutability.

- **Input and Output**:
  - Interacted with users through input prompts and formatted output messages.
  - Prompted the user for their name using the `input()` function and displayed a welcome message.
  - Asked the user to input two numbers, converted them to integers, calculated their sum and product, and displayed the results using formatted output.

- **Operators**:
  - Worked with various Python operators, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
  - Checked if a number is even or odd using the modulus operator.
  - Employed comparison operators to verify if a number is greater than or equal to 10.
  - Combined logical operators to create a complex condition and printed the result.

### Submission Details:

To submit the assignment, I saved my Python code in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file and uploaded it to my GitHub repository. I then shared the repository link for evaluation. The submission deadline for this assignment was 29-01-24.

Completing Assignment 3 was an enriching experience that allowed me to reinforce my understanding of Python fundamentals and enhance my programming skills.
