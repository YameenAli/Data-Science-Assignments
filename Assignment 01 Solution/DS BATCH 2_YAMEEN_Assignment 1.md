<!-- Task 1 Start  -->
### __Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (30 marks)__

__Data Description__

Download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com) provided for this assignment. The dataset contains information about [describe the dataset].

__Questions__

1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.  
2. Perform basic exploratory data analysis, including summary statistics and data visualization.
3. Identify any missing values and propose a strategy to handle them.
4. Create at least two meaningful visualizations to represent the insights gained from the data.

<!-- Task 2 Start -->
### __Task 2: Data Preprocessing (20 marks)__

__Data Cleaning__
1. Handle missing values based on the strategy proposed in Task 1.
2. Check for and handle any outliers in the dataset.

__Future Engineering__  
1. Crate a new feature that [describe the new feature].
2. Normalize or standardize relevant features.

<!-- Mathematical Formula  -->
$$ X_{normalized} = \frac{X - min(X)}{max(X)-min(X)} $$

Discuss the importance of normalization in the context of machine learning.

3. create a new feature (Z) that represent the interaction between two existing features (X) and (Y) using the formula:

$$ Z = \frac{X}{Y} $$

Provide a brief explanation of why you choose these features.

<!-- Task 3 Start -->
### __Task 3: Machine Learning (30 marks)__


__Model Building__
1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm and train a model.
3. evluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

__Hyperparameter Tuning__
1. Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance.
2. Discuss the impact of different hyperparameters on the model.

<!-- Task 4 Start -->
### __Task 4: Conclusion and Recommendations (20 marks)__
Write a conclusion based on your analysis and purpose andy recommendations for future work.


---

<!-- Task 5 Start -->
### __Task 5: Advanced Analysis (25 marks)__

__Question 4.1__

Apply a linear regression model to predict a target variable (Y) based on relevant features (X_1, X_2, X_n). Evualte the model's performance using the Mean Squared Erro (MSE) formula:

$$  MSE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - Y_i)^2 $$

__Question 5.2__  
Discuss the strengths and limitations of the linear regression model. propose potentail improvements

### Mathematical Formulas

- **Summation (Sigma): $ \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i $**
- **Theta ($\theta$): $\theta$**
- **Pi($\pi$): $\pi$**
- **Logarithm (log): $\log(x)$**
