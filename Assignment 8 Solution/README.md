# Assignment 8 - String Manipulation methods in Python

This repository contains solutions to Assignment 8, focusing on string manipulation methods in Python. The assignment consists of various scenarios and questions related to common string operations, such as searching, splitting, replacing, and formatting.

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce understanding and practice of fundamental string manipulation techniques in Python. Each question presents a scenario commonly encountered in software development and requires the application of specific string methods to solve the given problem.

## Structure
The assignment is organized into twelve questions, each addressing a different string manipulation scenario. For each question, a scenario is presented along with a specific string method to be utilized. Participants are required to provide solutions using Python code, demonstrating their understanding of the method's functionality and its application in real-world scenarios.

## Content
The assignment covers a wide range of string manipulation methods, including:
- `startswith()` and `endswith()` for pattern matching at the beginning and end of strings.
- `find()` for efficient keyword search within text documents.
- `isalnum()`, `isalpha()`, and `isdigit()` for validating and categorizing strings based on their content.
- `join()` for concatenating strings with a delimiter.
- `strip()` for removing leading and trailing whitespace characters.
- `replace()` for sanitizing user input by replacing sensitive substrings.
- `split()` for parsing log file lines into timestamp and event details.
- `lower()`, `islower()`, and `isupper()` for case manipulation and categorization.

## Usage
Each question in the assignment presents a scenario followed by a specific question related to string manipulation. Participants are encouraged to provide Python solutions for each question, demonstrating their understanding of the method's usage and its application in solving real-world problems.
