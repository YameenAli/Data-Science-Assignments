# Assignment 5 (Data Science 2)

This repository contains the solutions to Assignment 5 for the Data Science 2 course. The assignment covers various topics, including Python programming, data manipulation, and functional programming concepts.

## Questions

1. **Pattern Printing**: Display a specific pattern using a Python script.
2. **List Comparison**: Write a Python script to print the total number of common elements between two lists.
3. **Simple Calculator**: Implement a simple calculator program that performs arithmetic operations based on user input.
4. **Character Counting**: Write a Python script that takes a text statement from the user and counts the occurrences of a particular character.
5. **Functions**:
  - Implement a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width as positional arguments.
  - Create a function that prints a person's details (name, age, address) using keyword arguments.
6. **Lambda Functions**:
  - Implement a program that uses a lambda function to find the square of a given number.
  - Write a program that sorts a list of strings based on the length of each string using a lambda function.
7. **Filter, Map, and Reduce**:
  - Create a program that takes a list of strings as input, filters out strings with a length less than 5, converts the filtered strings to uppercase, and concatenates them into a single string using `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()`.
  - Write a program that reads a list of floating-point numbers from the user, rounds each number to two decimal places using `map()`, and finds the sum of the rounded numbers using `reduce()`.
  - Given a list of words, use `filter()` and `map()` to create a new list containing the lengths of words that have more than three characters.
